= Chauncey

Chauncey is a little Ruby library for expressing uncertainty in your code. Maybe you always wanted to program with probability?

The idea originated with Numeric#percent and Kernel#maybe, which Marcel Molina posted to Projectionist, a tumblelog.  This led to various snippets for executing code in a fuzzier way than usual.  You get such handy, wishy-washy methods as:

Date#at_some_point rather than Date#midnight
Array#pick(percentage) rather than iterating over every element
"maybe", "probably" and "rarely" blocks instead of the usual imperative block execution.
